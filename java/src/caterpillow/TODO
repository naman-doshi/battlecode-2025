changes made:
    - use TowerTracker, RobotTracker, etc for getNearest functions which are more specific
    - StrongRefillStrategy now actually tries really hard to refill
    - WeakRefillStrategy will only look or towers in vision and otherwise give up

general:
- fix tle
- hill climb macro strats
- dont make the scouts fully split up
    - group the first pair of scouts and make them split off after maybe
    - try to minimise the amount of time spent pending on coin
- strategy logic was changed after fixing some bugs which made some things better and some things worse
    - keep the behaviour we want, etc
    - a big one is refill logic

alex:
- why are you using markers to communicate what tower type when you could have just started building
