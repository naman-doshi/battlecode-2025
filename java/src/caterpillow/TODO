changes made:
- FIXED THE FUCKING 6000 BYTECODE .stream() ON AN EMPTY ARRAYLIST (??????????)
- slightly changed mid-tower build ruin trolling
- removed tower building cooldown from srp
- towers spawn mopper on enemy paint or enemy bots

general:
- fix tle
- hill climb macro strats
    - kinda sus of refill
- after optimising srp stuff, make scouts double as srp placers
    - is this even doable without infinite tle
- make scouts turn into srps later into the game
- make units not feed defence towers thanks
